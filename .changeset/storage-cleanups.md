Storage: superseded render generations and expired sources are removed from the scratch directory too, uploads are released when a project is deleted, and an hourly sweep removes orphaned files. `reelsaw storage` reports unique, leftover, duplicate-source and expired bytes; `reelsaw storage sweep [--dry-run]` runs the sweep on demand. Removed intro/outro assets that nothing references are purged after 30 days.
