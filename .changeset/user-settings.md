Settings are per person: everyone gets Account (name, password), Project defaults (vocabulary, instructions, language, clip length, pauses, caption style; applied to every new project, the new-project form starts from them) and API keys. Machine configuration and resource meters are shown to admins only, and `GET /api/health` includes them only for admins (or with `HEALTH_DETAILS=true`).
