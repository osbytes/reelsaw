Projects and the admin user list load in pages instead of all at once. The Projects page loads 24 at a time as you scroll (or with Load more), shows the true totals in its header, and only polls the projects that are processing. The admin Users page searches on the server (with `%` and `_` matched literally), shows "Showing 50 of N" and loads more on request. The `list_projects` MCP tool takes `limit` and `cursor` and returns `nextCursor` and `total`.
