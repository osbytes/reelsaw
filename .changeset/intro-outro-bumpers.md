Intro and outro videos: upload one of each in Settings and every clip of new projects is rendered as intro + clip + outro in a single encode. Bumpers are fitted to vertical with a blurred background, normalised once per asset, and an unusable one is skipped with a plain-language event instead of failing the clip. Exports gain `rendered_duration_sec`.
