Expected vs actual processing time: the project page shows elapsed and expected time for the running stage, the activity feed says how long each stage took against its expectation, and Settings → System → Machine (admins) has a per-stage expected vs actual table across recent projects. Expectations start from measured defaults (README, "What to expect") and become the median of your own finished projects that ran with the same models; there is no calibration step. Also a proper not-found page for missing projects and clips.

For contributors: `pnpm eval ... --matrix eval/bench/models.json` runs the suites once per model profile (env overrides on `.env`; cloud models through the Vercel AI Gateway, `gateway:<vendor>/<model>`) with latency, tokens and cost per profile side by side, and `pnpm bench:e2e` times the real pipeline per stage in an isolated compose stack, with `--steps refine,analyze` to re-run just those steps on one transcript. The first result set is in `eval/bench/results/2026-10-17-initial/`.
