Processing time is measured per run. Every retry, re-render, refine or re-analyze starts an explicit run (`run.started`), stage and project events carry their own durations, and the activity feed groups history by run with its reason and total. A clip re-rendered hours after a project finished now reports its own time instead of the time since the first run. Expected-time estimates, Processing times and `reelsaw status` read the same runs.
